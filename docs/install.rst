Step 0: The browser
-------------------

Step "zero" consists in installing a standard-compliant browser. Either
Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome will work well. Please try to avoid
Internet Explorer //X:  Why?.

Step 1: Installation
--------------------

The easiest way to install the *Jupyter Notebook App* is
installing a scientific python distribution which bundles it.
In this guide, we will use the Anaconda distribution released by the company Continuum.
Note that Anaconda currently (mid 2015) still uses the old name
*IPython Notebook* instead of *Jupyter Notebook App* but the software is the same.

- Download `Continuum Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_
  (free version), python 2.7, 64 bits. //This should open un a different tab or window; Also, is 64 bit necessary? There might be a few 32bit Windows 7 users out there, if not XP.

- Install it using the default settings for a single user.
